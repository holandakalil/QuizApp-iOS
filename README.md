# QuizApp-iOS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/holandakalil/QuizApp-iOS.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/holandakalil/QuizApp-iOS)

## Description
This is a pet project, I'll be practicing and trying *new things here. Some may not always work and I won't hesitate to remove it from the project if I think that is the case. This is intended as a place to learn new skills and try new things, so this project should keep changing with time.

## Goals
Improve and update the project over time with the intent to practice and showcase key subjects such as TDD and Modular design

## Technologies and Patterns
- Modular design, with scalability in mind
- Test Driven Development
- CI (with Travis CI)
- Generics
- SOLID principles 



*new to me (:
